# CoDLuaExporter
- Exports lua and font files from CoD games.
- Designed to work with **Cordycep**.

## Notes
- By launching the game through **Cordycep**, all files become accessible, this enables us to get a complete dump.
- Lua exporting for the latest game is disabled until it is no longer the active title.

## Requirements
- **Cordycep** is required to export files.
- Make sure the game is loaded with Cordycep before using this tool.
